# Quant Coursework & Mini Projects

## Overview
This repository collects a set of **small projects** where I explored ideas through simple research and data analysis.  
These are not full-scale production systems, but rather **lightweight experiments** to practice quantitative thinking, data handling, and exploratory coding.

Examples include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of **Powerball numbers**
- Building a simple **Hangman game AI**
- Prototyping **mini electricity trading decisions**

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate:
- **Breadth** of interests (quant finance, data science, games, energy markets)  
- **Hands-on coding practice** (Python, Jupyter, basic ML/EDA techniques)  
- Ability to **translate ideas into code quickly**

## Repository Structure
```
coursework-miniprojects/
├── powerball-eda/
│   └── notebook.ipynb         # exploratory analysis of lottery numbers
├── hangman-ai/
│   └── hangman_strategy.py    # simple guessing algorithm experiment
├── mini-electricity-trading/
│   └── decision_logic.ipynb   # toy prototype for trading decision rules
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains a **self-contained mini project** with code and (where useful) a short README or notebook description.

## Notes
- These projects are **simplified** by design: small datasets, lightweight algorithms, quick analysis.  
- They serve as **proof of work** for my ability to explore ideas, write clean code, and communicate results.  
- For more complete backtesting and research, please see my other repositories (e.g., [QuantConnect Strategy Backtest](https://github.com/ianzhangyi/QuantConnect-Lean-Strategy-Backtesting))
